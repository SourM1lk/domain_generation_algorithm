# Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)

This Rust program generates random domain names based on a seed value using a linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm. The generated domains are a combination of random characters and a randomly chosen domain extension.

## Algorithm

The program implements the LCG algorithm to generate pseudorandom numbers. The LCG function takes a seed value and parameters `a`, `c`, and `m` as inputs. It calculates the next pseudorandom number using the formula `(seed * a + c) % m`. The generated number becomes the new seed for the next iteration.

The `generate_domain` function generates a single random domain name based on a given seed. It first initializes the LCG parameters `a`, `c`, and `m`. Then, it generates a random domain length between 5 and 15 characters by applying the LCG algorithm. Next, it generates each character of the domain by applying the LCG algorithm and converting the generated number to a character code. Finally, it chooses a random domain extension from a predefined list and appends it to the domain name.

The `generate_domains_based_on_time` function generates a specified number of random domains based on the current date and time. It uses the current date in the format `YYYYMMDD` as the base seed value. It then iterates from 0 to the desired number of domains, incrementing the seed value by 1 for each iteration. It calls the `generate_domain` function with the incremented seed and collects the generated domains into a vector.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the above functions by generating 5 random domains based on the current time and printing them.
